# Implementation of ML Model for Image Classification

**Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification** is a project that integrates **MobileNetV2** and a **CIFAR-10** model for image classification. This project is built using Google Colab, allowing users to easily upload images and receive predictions with confidence scores from either model.

The notebook provides an interactive environment to experiment with image classification models, switch between models, and view real-time predictions directly in the Colab interface.

## Features

- **MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models**: Users can choose between two different pre-trained models for image classification.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Upload images and instantly receive predictions along with confidence scores for each class.
- **Easy-to-use Interface**: The Colab notebook is structured to allow simple image uploads and easy switching between models for comparative learning.

## Libraries Used

- `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for model loading, prediction, and integration.
- `Pillow` for image processing (image upload and pre-processing).
- `NumPy` for numerical computations and data handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a Google account to use Google Colab. Simply click the link to open the Colab notebook in your browser.

### Running the Colab Notebook

1. **Open the notebook**: Click the link below to open the notebook in Google Colab:
   
   [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

2. **Upload the image**: 
   - The notebook provides a cell for you to upload an image from your local system.
   - You can upload images by using Colabâ€™s file upload functionality.

3. **Select the Model**: 
   - In the notebook, you will find options to choose between the **MobileNetV2** or **CIFAR-10** model.

4. **Get Predictions**: 
   - Once you upload an image, the model will classify it and provide predictions with confidence scores.

5. **Switch Models**: 
   - Use the corresponding cells in the notebook to switch between the two models and compare results.

## Models Used

- **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight deep learning model for mobile devices, pre-trained on ImageNet for efficient image classification.
- **CIFAR-10 Model**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset for classifying images into 10 classes (airplane, car, bird, etc.).

## Requirements

The Colab notebook automatically installs the required libraries when you run the notebook. The necessary libraries include:

- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `pillow`
- `numpy`

The notebook includes cells to install these libraries automatically if they are not already installed.

```bash
!pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
```
